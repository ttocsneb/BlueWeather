Plans
=====

I need to have a better plan of what I want to do. The first thing to do is
better manage the settings.

Settings
--------

The settings should be simple, and only contain what is necessary. I do not
want it to be over complicated.

* Settings
    * Web
        * debug
        * Time Zone
        * allowed_hosts
        * database
        * secret key
    * System
        * Commands
    * plugins
        * weather driver
        * disabled plugins
        * plugin setings
